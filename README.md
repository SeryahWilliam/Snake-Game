## Welcome to my Snake Game project
This Snake Game is my very first coding project, created as part of my coursework at General Assembly. I began working on the project on March 7th 2024. This game is quite straightforward yet captivating, players navigate a snake to consume dots on the screen, with each dot eaten making the snake longer and the game progressively more challenging. The objective is to eat as many dots as possible without colliding into the snake's growing body or the walls. This project is a fun way to get introduced to coding and the basics of game development.
